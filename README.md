# Python Projects at Sumy State University

Welcome to my repository of Python projects developed during my studies at Sumy State University. This collection highlights various assignments, exercises, and projects that demonstrate my learning and proficiency in Python programming during the third semester.

## Overview

Throughout my coursework, I've engaged with a variety of programming concepts, ranging from basic syntax to more complex data structures and algorithms. This repository serves as a showcase of my progress and accomplishments in Python.

## Projects and Exercises

1. **Array Manipulation**  
   - Implemented programs to perform operations on one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.
   - Tasks included reversing elements, filling matrices according to specific patterns, and displaying arrays.

2. **List Operations**  
   - Created functions to manipulate lists based on user input.
   - Examples include removing elements by specified value and forming new lists from existing ones, such as extracting every third element.

3. **Set Processing**  
   - Developed programs that perform operations on sets, especially in contexts where direct operations are not feasible.
   - Analyzed text to determine whether vowels or consonants are more frequent, converting sets to lists and back as needed.

4. **Function Implementation**  
   - Practiced writing custom functions to execute specific tasks.
   - Emphasized code reusability and modular design.

## Learning Outcomes

- **Programming Skills**: Enhanced my understanding of Python, including advanced features and best practices.
- **Problem-Solving**: Improved my ability to tackle complex programming challenges logically and efficiently.
- **Code Management**: Gained experience with version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub.
- **Collaboration**: Learned the importance of clear documentation and code readability for collaborative projects.
